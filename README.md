# Introduction to Me!
Hello everyone! My name is **Emma Graham** and I am a first year Master's student in *Bioinformatics*. I have a Bachelor of Science in Molecular Biochemistry and Biophysics from Yale University. I am originally from Ottawa, but the more time I spend in Vancouver, the more I think the West Coast is really where it's at :) 

# Selected likes and dislikes

|    **Likes**    | **Dislikes** |

| Cats            | Bees         |
| People          | Empty spaces |
| Sour cream      | Avocados     |

I also (oddly) really like raccoons. Here's a gif of a raccoon playing a sprinkler like a harp that I think is pretty adorable:

# Reflections on making this document
I am having trouble commiting to GitHub directly from RStudio, so I just edited this from within GitHub. It was pretty great. Johannes' README example was very helpful. 

# Reflections on making the Gapminder Rmd file
Again, I was not able to commit from RStudio (it appeared that I had successfully committed from RStudio, but the files were not in my Github repository). Instead, I uploaded the files manually in the browswer. In addition, the Rmd file would not render until I had removed all instances of install.packages.
